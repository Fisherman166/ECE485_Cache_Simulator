//Use with a write buffer that only holds 1 item at a time to see if it will write back to DRAM when full
//Use 2 sets, 2 ways and 64 byte lines for this test

//Write two dirty lines to evict later
1 1001	//Write
1 200A	//Write

//Evict the first dirty line and print the write buffer
0 3004	//Read, NOHIT
9			//Print cache and write buffer

//Evict the second dirty line. The write buffer should write the previous
//line back to DRAM because it is full, and then put in the newly evicted line.
2 4008	//Read, NOHIT
9			//Print cache and write buffer
