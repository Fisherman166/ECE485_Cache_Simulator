//Assume:
// 2 sets
// 2 ways
// 64 byte lines
//
//This test will evict a non-dirty line from the cache, which should
//not end up in the posted write buffer.
//Then a dirty line will be evicted, which should end up in the write buffer
//The cache will be printed, showing the contents of the write buffer
//Then the line will be read in from the write buffer
//After 5 traces, the buffer will write the line back to memory and be empty again

//Non-dirty first
0 1001	//Read, HIT
1 200A	//Write

//Evict the non-dirty line.  Then print write buffer.  Should be empty
0 3004	//Read, NOHIT
9			//Print cache and write buffer

//Evict dirty line.  Print write buffer.  Should have the evicted line in it.
2 4008	//Read, NOHIT
9			//Print cache and write buffer

//Re-read the line currently in the write buffer
//Then print the write buffer to show the line has been written back to DRAM
0 200A	//Read, HIT -> reads from write buffer
0 200A	//Read, HIT -> reads from cache
0 200A	//Read, HIT -> next 2 only to complete 5 operations.
0 200A	//Read, HIT
9			//Print cache and write buffer
