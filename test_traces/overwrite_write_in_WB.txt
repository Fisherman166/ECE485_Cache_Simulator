//Assume:
// 2 sets
// 2 ways
// 64 byte lines
//
//This test evicts a dirty cache line into the write buffer
//Then it evicts the same dirty line again
//Tests to see if the write buffer only holds the newest value

//Fills both ways in a Set
1 1001	//Write
0 200A	//Read, HIT

//Evict the dirty line( line 0).  Then print write buffer.
0 3004	//Read, NOHIT
9	//Print cache and write buffer

//Write to the same address that is in the write buffer. That evicts line 1
//Then next 2 reads evicts line 0 and 1. 
//The second read evicts the same dirty line as before which overrides the old dirty 
//line already in the posted write buffer.
