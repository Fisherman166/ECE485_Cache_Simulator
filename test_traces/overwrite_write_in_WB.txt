//This test evicts a dirty cache line into the write buffer
//Then it writes to the same address again and evicts that line
//Tests to see if the write buffer only holds the newest value

//Use a 2 way cache for this test to make it simple.  2 sets would work fine as well

//Non-dirty first
1 1001	//Write
0 200A	//Read, HIT

//Evict the dirty line.  Then print write buffer.
0 3004	//Read, NOHIT
9	//Print cache and write buffer

//Write to the same address that is in the write buffer.  Then read 2 new lines
//in to evict the dirty line.  Should replace the original write in the buffer.
1 1001	//Write
0 400A	//Read, HIT
