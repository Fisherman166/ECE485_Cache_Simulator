//This test is for the cache with 2 sets, 4 ways, and 64 byte lines
//Byte select = 6 bits, index = 1 bits, tag = 26 bits
//Another simple test for LRU

//Checks to see what happens when other caches invalidate a few lines in a set
//Before evicting something

//Fill 3 lines
0 0	//Read, NOHIT
1 81	//Write, HIT
2 101	//Read, HIT

//Invalidate 0 and 2
3 0	//Snoop invalidate
3 101	//Snoop invalidate

//Fill the set
0 3200
0 3300
0 3400

//Lines 1 and then 2 should be evicted
1 3500
0 3602
